Blog app authentication System Overview

Registration:

Users sign up with username, email, and password.
Form validation ensures secure data input.
Login/Logout:

Login: Authenticates users with username and password.
Logout: Ends user sessions securely.
Profile:

Authenticated users can view and edit their profile, including email and optional fields like bio.
How It Works
Views:

Django's built-in views (login, logout) handle authentication.
Custom views manage registration and profile editing.
Templates:

Templates are provided for registration, login, logout, and profile.
Forms handle user input and validation errors.
Security:

CSRF tokens protect forms.
Passwords are securely hashed using Djangoâ€™s default hashing algorithms.
