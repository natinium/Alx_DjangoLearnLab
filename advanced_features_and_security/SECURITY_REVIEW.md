# Security Review

## Implemented Security Measures

HTTPS Enforcement: All traffic is redirected to HTTPS.
HSTS: Enforced via both Nginx and Django settings.
Secure Cookies: Session and CSRF cookies are only sent over HTTPS.
Security Headers: Implemented `X_FRAME_OPTIONS`, `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF`, and `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER`.

## Benefits

Data Integrity and Confidentiality: HTTPS ensures encrypted communication.
Protection Against Attacks: Security headers prevent XSS, clickjacking, and MIME-type sniffing attacks.

## Recommendations

Regular Updates: Keep Django and all dependencies up to date.
Monitoring: Implement monitoring for security breaches.
Additional Security: Consider using a WAF (Web Application Firewall) and intrusion detection systems.
